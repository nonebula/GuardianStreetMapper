        Welcome to Guardian Street Mapper. As you are probably aware, thefts are
        sky-high and happening at impossible rates in the current day. Theft is
        a violating and hurtful experience. As someone who has been robbed in
        the past, the repurcussions can last a long time. The sole mission of
        Guardian Street Mapper is to map any thefts that take place to raise
        awareness. This information is readily available to citizens and the
        police.{" "}
